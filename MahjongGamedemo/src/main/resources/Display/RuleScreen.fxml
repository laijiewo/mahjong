If the dealer points cannon, the score is doubled.&#10;- **Draw (黄庄)**: If there are only 7 sets of tiles (14 tiles) left in the wall, players must stop drawing. If there is a kong, one more tile must be left. If no one wins in this case, a new round begins with the same dealer.&#10;&#10;#### Winning Rules&#10;&#10;- **Basic Winning Hand**: A winning hand must have one pair (two identical tiles) and four sets of either sequences (three consecutive tiles) or triplets (three identical tiles).&#10;&#10;Beijing Mahjong commonly uses two types of rules: &quot;push down win&quot; and &quot;chi-pung-take.&quot;&#10;&#10;- **Push Down Win (推倒和)**: Win as long as the hand meets the basic or special hand requirements, without additional conditions.&#10;- **Chi-Pung-Take (吃碰提)**: Based on &quot;push down win&quot; but if the player is not in a &quot;concealed hand&quot; state, they cannot win by pointing cannon from another player and must win by self-draw.&#10;&#10;#### Scoring Rules&#10;&#10;- **Basic Score**: The basic score depends on the type of winning hand.&#10;- **Multipliers (番数)**: Scores are calculated based on the complexity of the hand (multipliers). The higher the multiplier, the higher the score.&#10;- **Penalties**: Violations may result in penalties.&#10;&#10;#### Special Hands&#10;&#10;- **Heavenly Hand (天胡)**: If the dealer wins immediately after the initial deal, it is called a Heavenly Hand, which usually has a high score.&#10;- **Earthly Hand (地胡)**: If a non-dealer wins with the first drawn tile, it is called an Earthly Hand, which also usually has a high score.&#10;&#10;#### Kong Scoring&#10;&#10;- **Kong Scoring**: When winning with kongs, they do not count towards multipliers but have extra scores. Each exposed kong earns 1 basic point from each player, and each concealed kong earns 2 basic points from each player. The dealer pays and receives double the kong points, and the pointing cannon player pays the same kong points as other players.&#10;&#10;#### Burning the Dealer Scoring&#10;&#10;- **Burning the Dealer (烧庄)**: If, after the dealer discards the first tile, the other three players discard the same tile, it is called &quot;burning the dealer.&quot; If burning occurs, the dealer pays each non-dealer 1 basic point. If burning continues from the second tile onwards, the points double each time. If the round ends in a draw, no burning points are paid.&#10;- If the first tile discarded by the dealer is a wind tile, the player to the south must discard the same tile if they have it. This rule applies to the players to the west and north as well. If the three players (south, west, north) have discarded the same wind tile, the player to the north must discard it if they have it. Otherwise, if the player to the north draws this tile later, they must show it to everyone. If the first tile discarded by the dealer is not a wind tile, the other three players are not obligated to discard the same tile.&#10;&#10;#### Annex 1:&#10;#### Annex 2: Common Special Hands and Scoring in Beijing Mahjong&#10;- **Self-draw**: 1 point.&#10;- **Concealed Hand**: Winning without any pung, chi, or exposed kong. 1 point.&#10;- **All Pungs**: Winning with 4 pungs and a pair. 1 point.&#10;- **Fully Concealed Hand**: Winning with 4 melds and waiting for the last tile to complete the pair. 1 point.&#10;- **Catch Five Kings**: Winning with a hand that only needs a &quot;Five of Characters&quot; tile. Typically includes &quot;Four-Six of Characters meld waiting for the Five of Characters,&quot; &quot;Single wait on the Five of Characters for the pair,&quot; and &quot;Seven Pairs with Five of Characters.&quot; 1 point.&#10;- **Moon Fishing**: Winning by self-draw on the last tile. If the last tile is discarded, it does not count as Moon Fishing. 1 point.&#10;- **Pure Straight**: Winning with a hand that contains a complete sequence from one to nine in one suit. 2 points.&#10;- **Seven Pairs**: Winning with a hand consisting of 7 pairs. 2 points. Does not overlap with Concealed Hand.&#10;- **Luxury Seven Pairs**: Winning with Seven Pairs where one pair consists of four of a kind. 3 points (additional 1 point on top of Seven Pairs). If there are more sets of four of a kind, each set adds 1 point. Does not overlap with Concealed Hand or Seven Pairs.&#10;- **Winning on a Kong**: Winning by drawing the winning tile after forming a kong. 2 points.&#10;- **Pure Suit**: Winning with a hand that consists of only one suit. 3 points.&#10;- **Level Up**: If the previous round ends in a draw, the scores in the current round are doubled. This is called &quot;Level Up.&quot; If there are consecutive drawn rounds, each time the scores are doubled until a normal winning round occurs, which then resets the scoring. 1 point.&#10;- **Heavenly Hand**: The dealer wins immediately after the initial deal. 6 points. Does not overlap with Concealed Hand; does not count if the dealer forms a concealed kong.&#10;- **Earthly Hand**: A non-dealer player wins with the first drawn tile. 5 points. Does not overlap with Concealed Hand; does not count if any player performs a chow, pung, or kong (including concealed kong) before the win.&#10;- **Human Hand**: The dealer discards a tile that leads to a win for another player on the first discard. 5 points. Does not overlap with Concealed Hand; does not count if the dealer forms a concealed kong.&#10;- **Mixed Kong**: Winning with a hand containing 4 jokers. 9 points. Mixed Kong must be self-drawn. It does not overlap with any other scoring types except for Heavenly Hand, Earthly Hand, Human Hand, or Level Up, and takes precedence over other scoring types.&#10;&#10;#### Annex 3: Scoring Multipliers&#10;- **Small Win**: ×1&#10;- **Simple Hand**: ×2&#10;- **Concealed Hand**: ×2&#10;- **Big Pung Hand**: ×2&#10;- **Pure Suit**: ×4&#10;- **Seven Pairs**: ×2&#10;- **Luxury Seven Pairs (and higher levels)**: ×4, ×8, ×16&#10;- **Kong and Flowering**: ×4&#10;- **Robbing Exposed Kong**: ×2&#10;- **Robbing Concealed Kong**: ×2&#10;- **Pure Straight**: ×2&#10;- **Mixed Dragon**: ×4&#10;- **Catch Five Kings**: ×2&#10;- **Moon Fishing**: ×2&#10;- **Heavenly Hand**: ×20&#10;- **Earthly Hand**: ×20&#10;- **Mixed Kong**: ×20" />
